  Now, please try to recall the exact wording of the two pieces of advice that Sarah gave you during the experiment and do the best you can to type her advice in the boxes below, exactly as she said it:</p>

<p>Sarah's first piece of advice to you</p>
<p><textarea rows="2" cols="100" name="firstPiece" ></textarea></p>

 
<p>Sarah's second piece of advice to you</p>
<p><textarea rows="2" cols="100" name="secondPiece" ></textarea></p>
